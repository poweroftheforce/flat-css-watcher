# ♡ Flat CSS Watcher ♡

Flat CSS Watcher / File Server for localhost for use with Resource Override

### Run
$ npm install
$ npm start

Right now the source and dist folders are hard coded within watcher.js as well as port
These variables can be changed to your desired preference (really the whole program can be) :]

- const srcDir
- const distDir
- const port
